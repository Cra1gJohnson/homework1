What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
merge allows for the combining of branches and integration of changes / differences between the two branches
Rebase allows for changes from one branch to be integrated into a separate different branch. Rebase keeps the branches separate and this is a large difference and therefore the two commands to significantly different things.
